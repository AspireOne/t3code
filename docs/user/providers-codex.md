# Codex

This guide is for people who want to use more than one Codex account in T3 Code. For Claude, see
[Claude](./providers-claude.md). For first-time setup, see [Install T3 Code](./install.md).

Common reasons:

- use a work account for work projects
- use a personal account for personal projects
- switch to another account when one account hits limits
- keep one shared Codex history instead of maintaining two separate Codex setups

## I Only Use One Codex Account

Use the default provider.

In Settings, your Codex provider can stay like this:

```text
Display name: Codex
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

Log in with Codex normally:

```bash
codex login
```

## Check account limits

When the selected Codex provider uses a ChatGPT account, the web and desktop message composer shows
the remaining five-hour and weekly limits beside the context-window ring. Hover or select this
combined usage control to see reset times and separate progress bars. The labels collapse to an
icon when the composer is narrow.

For a live thread, T3 Code reads limits from the exact Codex app-server process running that thread.
If `auth.json` changes after a thread starts, that thread keeps showing the account it is actually
using; a newly started thread can show the new account instead. T3 Code never substitutes another
account's limits when a live session cannot return them.

Before a thread starts, or after its session stops, the composer uses the selected provider
instance's current limits. T3 Code refreshes live-session limits periodically. API-key Codex setups
do not show account limits.

## Send feedback to OpenAI

In an existing Codex thread, send `/feedback` or `/feedback` followed by a description of the
issue. T3 Code uploads the thread and Codex logs to OpenAI and shows a thread ID that you can copy
and share with OpenAI employees.

## Reduce context usage

In an idle, existing Codex thread, send `/compact` by itself or use the compact action beside the
context-window meter. T3 Code shows the command and its progress while asking Codex to compact the
thread natively, then records the result in the work log. The action is available in the web and
desktop apps; mobile does not currently offer manual Codex compaction.

## Fork a conversation

In the web or desktop app, enter `/fork`, open an idle Codex thread's menu and choose **Fork
thread**, or run **Fork current thread** from the command palette. T3 Code creates a second thread containing the
conversation through the latest completed turn and opens it immediately. The original and fork are
independent after that point.

Forking uses Codex's native conversation fork, so it is available only after at least one turn has
completed and while no turn or approval is pending. Other providers and the mobile app do not
currently offer this action. The `chat.fork` keybinding command has no default shortcut; assign one
under **Settings → Keybindings** if wanted.

## Sub-agent models

The web and desktop Agents panel shows each sub-agent's model and reasoning effort when Codex
reports them. If Codex does not report either value, T3 Code leaves it out instead of using the
parent agent's settings.

## Approve access to other apps

When a Codex tool needs access to an app such as Safari, T3 Code shows the app name and asks for
approval. You can approve, decline, or cancel the request from the desktop app, web app, or mobile
app. Some tools also offer approval for the current session or permanent approval.

## I Want Work And Personal Codex Accounts

Use one real Codex home and one shadow home.

Recommended setup:

```text
~/.codex      shared Codex home
~/.codex_p    second account auth
```

The idea is:

- both accounts can see the same T3/Codex sessions
- each account keeps its own login
- existing threads can continue with either account

### Set Up The First Account

Log in normally:

```bash
codex login
```

This is the account used by `~/.codex`.

In T3 Code Settings, name it something obvious:

```text
Display name: Codex Work
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

### Set Up The Second Account

Log in with a separate Codex home:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex_p
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_p codex login
```

In T3 Code Settings, add another Codex provider:

```text
Display name: Codex Personal
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

The important part is that both providers use the same `CODEX_HOME path`, but only the second one
has a `Shadow home path`.

## Which Account Am I Using?

Open Settings and look at the provider row.

T3 Code shows the authenticated email for providers that report one. Emails are blurred by default;
click the blurred email to reveal it.

Use display names and accent colors to make accounts easy to tell apart in the model picker.

## I Need A Different API Key Or Endpoint

Use the provider's Environment variables section in Settings.

This is useful when a Codex-compatible setup needs account-specific variables. Add the variables to
the provider instance that should receive them, and mark API keys or tokens as sensitive. Sensitive
values are stored as server secrets and are not sent back to the app after saving.

## Can I Switch Accounts In An Existing Thread?

Yes, when both Codex providers share the same `CODEX_HOME path`.

For example:

```text
Codex Work      CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Codex Personal  CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex, Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

Those two providers are considered compatible for continuation, so the locked model picker can show
both.

If you add a third Codex provider with a completely different `CODEX_HOME path`, T3 Code treats it
as a different workspace. It will not be offered for existing threads created under `~/.codex`.

## If Both Accounts Look The Same

If two Codex providers show the same account or the same unexpected model list:

1. Check the email in Settings.
2. Refresh provider status.
3. Confirm the second provider has `Shadow home path` set.
4. Confirm the shadow directory has its own `auth.json`.
5. If you copied `~/.codex` into the shadow directory, remove everything except `auth.json`.

Example cleanup:

```bash
find ~/.codex_p -mindepth 1 ! -name auth.json -exec rm -rf {} +
```

## When To Use A Separate CODEX_HOME

Use a totally separate `CODEX_HOME path` only when you want a separate Codex workspace.

That means separate sessions and less account switching inside old threads. Most dual-account users
should use the shared-home plus shadow-home setup instead.
